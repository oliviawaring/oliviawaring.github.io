Aloha! 

I am a PhD student in linguistics at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, where my research lies at the intersection of endangered language documentation and computational linguistics. I am particularly interested in developing computational platforms and pedagogical tools to facilitate community-driven language documentation and reclamation. My other research interests include community radio as a vehicle for revitalization, morpho-syntax morphology, and education for women and girls in the developing world. I have served as the senior co-director of the Language Documentation Training Center, and I currently work on language documentation and revitalization projects in Alaska (Eyak), Micronesia (Carolinian), and India (Tewa). I also work as a classical radio host at <a href="https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/people/olivia-waring" target="_blank">Hawaiʻi Public Radio</a> (and previously at <a href="https://www.classicalwcrb.org/blog/2020-03-25/radio-hosting-in-the-time-of-covid-19" target="_blank">Classical Radio Boston</a>).
