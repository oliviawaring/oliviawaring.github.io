### SITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Aloha! 

I am a PhD student in linguistics at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, where my research lies at the intersection of endangered language documentation and computational linguistics. I am particularly interested in developing computational platforms and pedagogical tools to facilitate community-driven language documentation and reclamation. My other research interests include community radio as a vehicle for revitalization, morpho-syntax, and education for women and girls in the developing world. I have served as the senior co-director of the <a href="ldtc.org">Language Documentation Training Center</a>, and I currently work on language documentation and revitalization projects in Alaska (Eyak), Micronesia (Carolinian), and India (Tewa). 

I also work as a classical radio host at <a href="https://www.hawaiipublicradio.org/people/olivia-waring" target="_blank">Hawaiʻi Public Radio</a> (and previously at <a href="https://www.classicalwcrb.org/blog/2020-03-25/radio-hosting-in-the-time-of-covid-19" target="_blank">Classical Radio Boston</a>). I love singing, acting, playing the violin, hiking, snorkeling, chemistry puns, <a href="https://guinneagram.com/" target="_blank">guinea pigs</a>, and my fluffy cat Baloo. Mahalo for visiting!


#### Hōʻoia ʻĀina — Land Acknowledgement 

I acknowledge Hawaiʻi as an Indigenous space whose original people are today identified as Native Hawaiians. Situated on lands which were ceded under duress, the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa strives to be a Native Hawaiian Place of Learning, committed to the values of <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/nhpol/aloha-aina/" target="_blank">aloha ‘āina</a>. As a settler who is privileged to live and work on these lands, I seek to support the varied strategies that the Indigenous peoples of Hawai‘i are using to protect their land and their communities, and I am committed to dedicating time and resources to working in solidarity. 

(This Land Acknowledgement was crafted in part by <a href="https://gmholton.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Gary Holton</a>.)
