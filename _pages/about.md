Aloha! 

I am a PhD student in linguistics at the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa, where my research lies at the intersection of endangered language documentation and computational linguistics. I am particularly interested in developing computational platforms and pedagogical tools to facilitate community-driven language documentation and reclamation. My other research interests include community radio as a vehicle for revitalization, polysynthetic morphology, and education for women and girls in the developing world. I have served as the senior co-director of the Language Documentation Training Center, and I currently work on language documentation and revitalization projects in Alaska (Eyak), Micronesia (Carolinian), and India (?). I also work as a classical radio host at Hawaiʻi Public Radio (and previously at Classical Radio Boston).
